# Poker-Probability-Calculator
A Python-based program that calculates poker hand probabilities in Texas Hold'em using Monte Carlo simulations. It analyzes the chances of winning, losing, or tying based on a player’s hole cards and community cards.

## Features:
- Simulates Texas Hold'em hands
- Calculates win probabilities in real-time
- Evaluate hand strength (pair, flush, straight, etc.)
- Uses Monte Carlo simulation for outcome prediction

## Installation:
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/username/poker-probability-calculator.git
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd poker-probability-calculator
3. Run the program
